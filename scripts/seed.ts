/**
 * Database Seeding Script
 *
 * This script populates the database with initial data for development and testing.
 * It demonstrates several important concepts:
 *
 * 1. SECURE PASSWORD HANDLING: Using bcrypt to hash passwords before storing
 * 2. DATA RELATIONSHIPS: Creating users, teams, and players with proper foreign keys
 * 3. MANY-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIPS: Randomly assigning players to teams via junction table
 * 4. TRANSACTION SAFETY: Clearing existing data and rebuilding from scratch
 *
 * SEEDING BEST PRACTICES:
 *
 * - Use external JSON files for data (easy to modify without code changes)
 * - Hash passwords with bcrypt (same security as production)
 * - Create realistic test data (useful for UI development)
 * - Clear existing data first (idempotent - can run multiple times)
 * - Provide clear console output (debugging and monitoring)

/**
 * Main Seeding Function
 *
 * This function orchestrates the entire database seeding process:
 * 1. Read mock data from JSON file
 * 2. Clear existing data (for clean rebuild)
 * 3. Create users with hashed passwords
 * 4. Create teams and players owned by users
 * 5. Randomly assign players to teams (many-to-many relationships)
 *
 * The seeding process is designed to be:
 * - IDEMPOTENT: Can run multiple times safely
 * - REALISTIC: Creates data useful for development/testing
 * - SECURE: Hashes passwords just like in production
 * - OBSERVABLE: Provides detailed console output
